All companies that have a large number of company cars install GPS devices. With these GPS devices they follow the route and the speed of the driver. Unfortunately keeping low speed is not the only indicator of safe driving. “Sports” style of driving, inattention to holes along the way, sudden starting and stopping at traffic lights are massive phenomena especially when driving a foreign car.

DriveStyle is a project based on Arduino Uno. Its aim is to track the route, speed and accelerations in all three axes. All data is saved onto a SD card and analyzed with a Python software.
